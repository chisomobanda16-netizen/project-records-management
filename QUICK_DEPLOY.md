## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If ZIP upload fails:
- Try extracting the ZIP first
- Upload files manually (see above)

### If deployment fails:
- Make sure all files are uploaded
- Check file names (no spaces, special characters)
- Try again - Cloudflare is very reliable

### If site doesn't work:
- Check that `login.html` exists
- Verify EmailJS settings in live site
- Test with different browsers

## ✅ Success Checklist

After deployment, test these:
- [ ] Login page loads
